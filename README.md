Sqlitex
=======

An Elixir wrapper around [https://github.com/mmzeeman/esqlite](esqlite). The main aim here is to provide convenient usage of sqlite databases.

Plans
=====

This package currently only supports really basic reads. I am building this package as an attempt to learn more about Elixir and I'll be adding features only as I need them.

I would love to get any feedback I can on how other people might want to use SQlite with Elixir.
